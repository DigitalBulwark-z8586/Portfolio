# 🛡️ Zachary Hanselman's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio. This space showcases hands-on work I've completed to build technical depth in threat detection, system hardening, and automation — all aligned with real-world SOC and IT operations environments.

I hold a **BBA in Computer Information Systems** with a concentration in **Information Security and Assurance** from **Texas A&M University–San Antonio**, and I am **Security+ certified** with an **active Secret Security Clearance**. Below are the core projects in this portfolio:

---

## 🖥️ Post-Reimaging Automation Script (PowerShell)

🔗 [View Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/Post-Imaging-Script)

A PowerShell script that automates essential post-imaging checks for newly deployed Windows systems. It collects:
- Computer manufacturer and hostname
- IP and MAC address details from enabled adapters

This tool supports IT teams in reducing post-deployment errors and speeds up endpoint validation.

## 🏠 Home SOC Lab (AWS + Splunk)

🔗 [View Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/Home-SOC-Lab)

A simulated cloud-based SOC environment built using:
- **Splunk Enterprise** for SIEM and alerting
- **AWS EC2** instances with Windows and Linux hosts
- **Sysmon**, firewall, and system logs for log correlation
- Real-time monitoring of endpoint behavior and lateral movement attempts

This lab demonstrates Tier 1 SOC analyst workflows, detection engineering, and incident response fundamentals.

## 📡 Python Network Packet Analyzer

🔗 [View Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Traffic-Analyzer)

A Python script that performs:
- Live or offline **packet analysis**
- **GeoIP lookup** of external connections
- **Syslog forwarding** for SIEM alerting
- Flagging of potential DNS tunneling and ICMP anomalies

This tool was built to enhance my understanding of packet-level visibility and integrate custom detections into SIEM platforms.
